There is a bug with win checking. This board has a horizontal right win (or Diagonal check (â†™)), however it isn't being counted. This seems to be consistent as well.

Before:
1 1 0 2 2 2 1
1 1 0 2 2 1 2
2 1 0 2 1 1 2
2 2 1 1 2 2 1
2 2 2 1 1 1 2
1 2 1 1 1 2 1

Bugged board state:
1 1 0 2 2 2 1
1 1 0 2 2 1 2
2 1 2 2 1 1 2
2 2 1 1 2 2 1
2 2 2 1 1 1 2
1 2 1 1 1 2 1
